## 1. Understanding the Development Model

Before you begin coding, it is important to understand how development
is organized in this project.

### Branching Strategy

We use the following branches:

- `master` — contains stable releases only
- `develop` — active development and integration branch
- Short-lived branches — one branch per contribution

All standard contributions must target the `develop` branch. This means:

- Do **not** open Pull Requests against `master`
- Always create branches from `develop`
- Always target `develop` when opening a Pull Request

See ADR easyscience/.github#12 for full details on the branching
strategy.

---

## 2. Getting the Code

### 2.1. If You Are an External Contributor

If you are not a core maintainer of this repository, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/easyscience/utils`

- Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner). This creates a copy of
  the repository under your GitHub account.

- Clone your fork locally:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/utils.git
  cd utils
  ```

- Add the original repository as `upstream`:

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/easyscience/utils.git
  ```

- Ensure you are working on the `develop` branch:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout develop
  git pull upstream develop
  ```

- If you have contributed previously, ensure that your local `develop`
  branch is up to date before starting new work.

  To synchronize your branch with the latest changes:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git pull upstream develop
  ```

### 2.2. If You Are a Core Team Member

Core team members do not need to fork the repository. You may create
branches directly from `develop`, but the remainder of the workflow is
the same.

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment

You only need:

- Git
- Pixi

EasyScience projects use **Pixi** for environment and task management.
To install Pixi, follow the official
[installation instructions](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation/)

You do **not** need to manually install a specific Python version. Pixi
automatically:

- Creates the appropriate Python environment
- Installs all required dependencies
- Installs development tools (linters, formatters, test tools)

Install and configure the environment:

```bash
pixi install
pixi run post-install
```

After this step, your local development environment is fully configured.

See ADR easyscience/.github#63 for the rationale behind using Pixi.

---

## 4. Creating a Feature Branch

Never work directly on `develop`.

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
```

Use a descriptive name such as:

- `improve-solver-speed`
- `fix-boundary-condition`
- `add-tutorial-example`

Clear branch names improve review clarity and repository history.

---

## 5. Implementing Your Changes

While developing your contribution:

- Make small, logical commits
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Follow the Google docstring convention
- Add or update unit tests for any modified behavior

Example commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Improve performance of time integrator for large systems"
```

Run tests locally:

```bash
pixi run unit-tests
```

Running tests frequently during development is strongly recommended.

---

## 6. Code Quality Checks

Before opening a Pull Request, always run:

```bash
pixi run check
```

This command runs:

- Code formatting checks
- Linting (style checks)
- Docstring validation
- Notebook checks
- Unit tests
- Other project validations

A successful run should look similar to:

```bash
pixi run pyproject-check...................................Passed
pixi run py-lint-check.....................................Passed
pixi run py-format-check...................................Passed
pixi run nonpy-format-check................................Passed
pixi run docs-format-check.................................Passed
pixi run notebook-format-check.............................Passed
pixi run unit-tests........................................Passed
```

If any checks fail, carefully review the error messages and address the
reported issues.

The full `pixi run check` command may take some time. At a minimum,
always run it before opening a Pull Request.

You may also execute individual checks separately, for example:

```bash
pixi run py-lint-check
```

Some issues (such as formatting) may be automatically fixable using:

```bash
pixi run fix
```

After running this command, you should normally see:

```text
✅ All code auto-formatting steps have been applied.
```

This indicates that the auto-formatting pipeline completed successfully.
If you do not see this message and no error messages appear, try running
the command again.

If errors are reported, resolve them and re-run:

```bash
pixi run check
```

All checks must pass before your Pull Request can be merged.

If a check fails and you are unsure how to resolve it, you may ask for
help in your Pull Request discussion.

---

## 7. Opening a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin my-change
```

On GitHub:

- Click **Compare & Pull Request**
- Ensure the base branch is `develop`
- Provide a clear and descriptive title (see below)
- Add a meaningful description explaining what changed and why
- Add a `[scope]` label (see below)

### Pull Request Title

The PR title is used directly in release notes and changelogs, so it
should be concise, specific, and informative. It must clearly describe
what changed without unnecessary detail.

Good examples:

- Improve performance of time integrator for large systems
- Fix incorrect boundary condition handling in solver
- Add adaptive step-size control to ODE solver
- Add tutorial for custom model configuration
- Refactor solver API for improved readability

### Required `[scope]` Label

Every Pull Request must include one `[scope]` label, which determines
the version impact of the change:

| Label                   | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[scope] bug`           | Bug report or fix (major.minor.**PATCH**)                               |
| `[scope] documentation` | Documentation-only changes (major.minor.patch.**POST**)                 |
| `[scope] enhancement`   | Adds or improves features (major.**MINOR**.patch)                       |
| `[scope] maintenance`   | Code/tooling cleanup without feature or bug fix (major.minor.**PATCH**) |
| `[scope] significant`   | Breaking or major changes (**MAJOR**.minor.patch)                       |

See ADR easyscience/.github#33 for complete details on label rules and
versioning.

---

## 8. Continuous Integration (CI)

After you open a Pull Request:

- Automated tests and checks run automatically
- You will see status indicators (green checkmarks or red crosses)

If CI fails:

1. Open the failing check
2. Review the logs
3. Fix the issue locally
4. Run `pixi run check`
5. Push the changes

The Pull Request updates automatically after each push.

---

## 9. Code Review

All Pull Requests are reviewed by at least one core team member.

Code review is:

- Collaborative
- Constructive
- Focused on improving quality

Please do not take review comments personally — they are intended to
help improve the contribution.

To update your PR:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Address review comments"
git push
```

---

## 10. Documentation Contributions

If your change affects users, the documentation must be updated
accordingly.

This may include:

- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Tutorials
- Jupyter notebooks

To preview documentation locally:

```bash
pixi run docs-serve
```

Open the local URL displayed in the terminal and navigate to the
relevant section to verify your changes.

---

## 11. Reporting Issues

If you identify a bug but do not wish to submit a fix:

- Search existing issues first
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include relevant logs and environment details

Well-documented issue reports greatly assist maintainers.

---

## 12. Security Issues

Do **not** report security vulnerabilities publicly.

If you discover a potential security issue, contact the maintainers
privately.

---

## 13. Releases

Releases are created by merging `develop` into `master`.

Once your contribution is merged into `develop`, it will automatically
be included in the next stable release.

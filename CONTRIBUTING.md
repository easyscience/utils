# Contributing to EasyUtilities

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **EasyUtilities**!

We welcome contributions of all kinds:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Tutorials and examples
- Unit and integration tests
- Feedback and discussions

Contributing to open source can feel overwhelming at first — especially
if you are new to GitHub workflows. This guide explains the full process
step by step.

Please make sure you follow the EasyScience organization-wide
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/easyscience/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Quick Overview of the Process

If you already know how GitHub contributions work, here is the short
version:

1. Fork the repository (unless you are a core team member)
2. Create a new branch from `develop`
3. Set up your development environment using `pixi install`
4. Make your changes and add tests
5. Check your code with `pixi run check`
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `develop`
7. Assign the required `[scope]` label

If you are unsure about any step, continue reading below.

## 1. Understanding the Development Model

Before you start coding, it is important to understand how development
works in this project.

### Branching Strategy

We use the following branches:

- `master` — contains stable releases only
- `develop` — active development and integration branch
- Short-lived branches — one branch per contribution

All normal contributions must target the `develop` branch.

This means:

- Do NOT open Pull Requests against `master`
- Always branch from `develop`
- Always target `develop` in your PR

See ADR easyscience/.github#12 for the full branching strategy and
reasoning.

---

## 2. Getting the Code

### If You Are an External Contributor

If you are not a core maintainer of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub:
   `https://github.com/easyscience/utils`

2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner). This creates a copy of
   the repository under your GitHub account.

3. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/utils.git
cd utils
```

4. Add the original repository as `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/easyscience/utils.git
```

5. Make sure you are working on the `develop` branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

This ensures your local copy is up to date.

> If you have contributed before, always update your local `develop`
> branch before starting new work.

---

### If You Are a Core Team Member

Core team members do not need to fork the repository. You can create
branches directly from `develop`, but the rest of the process remains
the same.

---

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment

EasyScience projects use **Pixi** for environment and task management.

You only need:

- Git
- Pixi

You do NOT need to manually install a specific Python version. Pixi
automatically:

- Creates the correct Python environment
- Installs all required dependencies
- Installs development tools (linters, formatters, test tools)

Install and configure the environment:

```bash
pixi install
pixi run post-install
```

After this, your local development environment is fully configured.

If anything fails during installation, carefully read the error message.
Most common problems are due to outdated Pixi or missing system
dependencies.

See ADR `easyscience/.github#63` for the reasoning behind using Pixi.

---

## 4. Creating a Feature Branch

Never work directly on `develop`.

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
```

Use a descriptive name such as:

- `improve-solver-speed`
- `fix-boundary-condition`
- `add-tutorial-example`

This makes review and history easier to understand.

---

## 5. Implementing Your Changes

While working on your change:

- Make small, logical commits
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Follow the Google docstring convention
- Update or add unit tests for changed behavior

Example commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Improve performance of time integrator for large systems"
```

Run tests locally:

```bash
pixi run unit-tests
```

It is good practice to run tests frequently while developing.

---

## 6. Code Quality Checks

Before opening a Pull Request, always run:

```bash
pixi run check
```

This command runs:

- Code formatting checks
- Linting (style checks)
- Documentation validation
- Notebook checks
- Unit tests
- Other project validations

If formatting issues are detected:

```bash
pixi run fix
```

After running `pixi run fix`, re-run:

```bash
pixi run check
```

All checks must pass before your Pull Request can be merged.

If a check fails and you do not understand the error, you can:

- Read the error message carefully
- Search the repository for similar examples
- Ask for help in your Pull Request

---

## 7. Opening a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin my-change
```

On GitHub:

- Click **Compare & Pull Request**
- Make sure the base branch is `develop`
- Provide a clear and descriptive title
- Add a meaningful description of what changed and why

### Required `[scope]` Label

Every Pull Request must include one `[scope]` label, which determines
the version impact of the change:

| Label                   | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[scope] bug`           | Bug report or fix (major.minor.**PATCH**)                          |
| `[scope] documentation` | Documentation only changes (major.minor.patch.**POST**)            |
| `[scope] enhancement`   | Adds/improves features (major.**MINOR**.patch)                     |
| `[scope] maintenance`   | Code/tooling cleanup, no feature or bugfix (major.minor.**PATCH**) |
| `[scope] significant`   | Breaking or major changes (**MAJOR**.minor.patch)                  |

See ADR `easyscience/.github#33` for full details about label rules.

---

## 8. Continuous Integration (CI)

After you open a Pull Request:

- Automated tests and checks run automatically
- You will see status indicators (green checkmarks or red crosses)

If CI fails:

1. Click on the failing check
2. Read the logs
3. Fix the problem locally
4. Run `pixi run check`
5. Push again

Your PR updates automatically after each push.

---

## 9. Code Review

All Pull Requests are reviewed by at least one core team member.

Code review is:

- Collaborative
- Constructive
- Focused on improving quality

Do not take comments personally — they are meant to help.

To update your PR:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Address review comments"
git push
```

---

## 10. Documentation Contributions

If your change affects users, documentation must be updated.

This may include:

- API documentation
- Examples
- Tutorials
- Jupyter notebooks

To preview documentation locally:

```bash
pixi run docs-serve
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal.

---

## 11. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug but do not want to fix it yourself:

- Search existing issues first
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include logs and environment details

Clear bug reports help maintainers tremendously.

---

## 12. Security Issues

Do NOT report security vulnerabilities publicly.

If you discover a vulnerability, contact the maintainers directly.

---

## 13. Releases (Informational)

Releases are created by merging `develop` into `master`.

Once your contribution is merged into `develop`, it will automatically
be included in the next stable release.

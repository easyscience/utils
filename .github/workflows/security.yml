# Code scanning (CodeQL) for vulnerabilities and insecure coding patterns.
#
# What this workflow does
# - Runs GitHub CodeQL analysis and uploads results to your repository's Security tab.
# - Triggers on PRs (so findings appear as PR checks) and on pushes to `develop`.
# - Runs on a weekly schedule.
#
# Where to find results on GitHub
# - Repository → Security → Code scanning alerts
#   (You can filter by tool = CodeQL and by branch.)
#
# Where to configure on GitHub
# - Repository → Settings → Advanced Security
#   Enable "GitHub Advanced Security" (if available) and configure CodeQL there.
# - Repository → Security → Code scanning alerts
#   This page shows findings produced by this workflow.
#
# Notes about the scheduled run
# - Scheduled workflows are triggered from the repository's *default branch*.
#   If your default branch is `master` but you want the scheduled scan to analyze
#   `develop`, this workflow checks out `develop` explicitly for scheduled runs.
